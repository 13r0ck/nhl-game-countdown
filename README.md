Always know how long until the start of your team's next game!


## Build for [LaMetric](https://lametric.com)!



## 100% Open Source
All of the code here is what runs on my server. There is no tracking and I log **none** of the data. If you would like to run your own server the docker file is provided, and can be built as follows.
```bash
sudo docker build -t nhl-game-countdown . && sudo docker run --env PORT='8080' -p 8080:8080 nhl-game-countdown
```

The API is very simple. Just create a `GET` request to `https://nhl.gtcountdown.com/?team=<team_name>`

For example: `https://nhl.gtcountdown.com/?team=Colorado+Avalanche`
The `team` names are all in plain engligh, but the full list is provided below.
